        <p id="p1">Roronoa Zoro (ロロノア・ゾロ, spelled as "Roronoa Zolo" or "Roronoa Zollo" in some English adaptations), nicknamed "Pirate Hunter" Zoro (海賊狩りのゾロ Kaizoku-Gari no Zoro), is a fictional character in the One Piece franchise created by Eiichiro Oda.

          In the story, Zoro is the first to join Monkey D. Luffy after he is saved from being executed at the Marine Base. He is one of the two swordsmen of the Straw Hat Pirates, the other being Brook. As a native to the East Blue, he came from the town known as Shimotsuki, where he trained in a dojo and learned the one and two-sword styles (ittōryū and nitōryū). Zoro is uniquely known as an expert of Santōryū (Three Sword Style), where he wields a third sword with his mouth in combat. Throughout the series, his primary sword is Wado Ichimonji, a sword that he inherited from a childhood friend, and is frequently the sword that he wields in his mouth.
